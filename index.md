# Data Description

 My research in robotics centers on child-robot interaction and how robots can help children with motor impairments receive the benefits that come with motor exploration and play. For children with motor impairments, they tend to be delayed in motor milestones such as crawling, walking, and running but an assistive robot may be a fun and more ideal way for children to practice motor skills. Studies have shown that treadmill training or similar types of interventions can promote early motor skills for children with motor impairments, but they can be boring and quite intense. Our assistive robot is combined with a body-weight support harness which allows supported but free motion for a child in a play space. The two combined means the assistive robot is a motivational tool that the child can chase around and play with while practicing crawling and walking skills. Our main research question is how well can an assistive robot encourage motor exploration and development in children with or without disabilities?

  For my studies, we will be collecting several forms of human-subjects data that I will describe and list out:
1.	Video data recording on children interacting with the robot during studies. This will usually be in the form of overhead video on a GoPro of a play space where a child and robot will be interacting. The video files will be collected and stored for post-hoc analysis. 
2.	Accelerometer data on devices worn by children during the studies. This data is stored in the device during the study and then uploaded later to the software and saved as spreadsheet files. We will analyze the data after each study. 
3.	Qualitative data. We will be collecting survey and interview data during studies. We will collect survey data in the form of printed forms that will be filled out during each play session by a parent or guardian. Interviews will be conducted in a semi-structured fashion and captured either with audio or video recordings which will be stored and analyzed later. 
  In addition to human-subjects data, we also will be collecting data on the robot while it is moving which will be used to further develop the algorithms which control the robot. This data will be in the form of logs of each action the robot performs and when so that it can be matched up to video data. Additionally, we have simulated data of child-robot interaction which generate text files of each action performed and how successful it was at encouraging motion in the simulated child.

* For the video data, we anticipate collecting 10-50 GBs.
* For the accelerometer data, we anticipate collecting up to 1-5 GBs worth of data.
* For the survey data, we expect to collect in the 1-10 GBs range of data due mainly to the interview recordings. The rest will be low impact.
* For data collected by the robot and simulated data, we anticipate about 100 MB worth of data.

# Roles and Responsibilities

The PI is responsible for generation and implementation of the DMP as they were the grant writer and had to include that as part of the grant proposal. They would have had assistance from co-PI’s to help ensure the plan made sense, protected data appropriately as we are working with human subjects, and was carried out effectively. The rest of the roles fall mainly to the graduate students and their undergraduates that they mentor. The graduate students, including myself and 2 others, are responsible for data collection/generation, data organization, archiving and preservation, protection of sensitive and protected data, data analysis, software creation and maintenance and instrumentation maintenance. If one of the graduate students or researchers involved with the project should leave, the responsibility falls to the PI to ensure the data is still maintained properly and that the project continues to move forward.

The data that I will collect will be sensitive and need to be protected as it involves child subjects. Our plan is to ensure that any data collected is secured and can only be accessed by members of the research team who have gone through the required IRB trainings to ensure they can be responsible with the data. On our consent forms, it indicates that some screenshots and gifs may be used from the studies in research papers and presentations but will not show identifying features such as faces. This allows parents to decide if they are comfortable with images or gifs being made from the videos and lets them know that only non-face identifying images will be used. Because we are using overhead video as our primary method of data evaluation, it is much easier to ensure that no identifying features are readily available. 

Data will be stored in a protected Google Drive which can only be accessed by members of the research team who have gone through the appropriate trainings and received the IRB certifications that allow access to sensitive data. Only Oregon State students and faculty that are approved can access the data and after someone leaves the university, they will be unable to access the data. Some data may be stored temporarily on local computers while being transferred over, but laptops will be secured via password and not shared with others outside of the research team. There will also be password protected hard drives which will also contain copies of the video data as backups.

There will be 2 copies of the data. One will be stored in google drive as the primary while the backups will live on password protected hard drives. This process is manual and the management of the Google Drive is also manual. We will be using no programs specifically to backup the data, only manual file transferring. We will be using a cloud system but the primary manager is the PI. The PI will ensure that data is transferred over through a graduate or undergraduate student when one leaves. This ensures that the data isn’t lost to an account that is deleted by the OSU system. 

# Data Standards and Metadata

A. Data will be organized and labeled the same in both the google drive and local storage. At a high level, the project can be broken down by paper and grant related to the paper (i.e. Caplan or Infant Behavior Modeling). Within each high-level folder, subdivisions breaking down individual papers related to the grant will be useful. Witin each paper, files can be separated into elements such as data or figures or reading. Files will be labeled with date of creation and descriptive text of the file. Because we collect video files as well, data will be stored by date and camera location with descriptive text labeling which aspect of the study the video is from (e.g., baseline_session1_front_canon).

B. Version control will be done through github for all software. This will allow software to be more easily accessible. Branches will only be created if the same data or tool is being used for a different purpose and will differ significantly from the original structure.

C. Direct metadata other than video metadata will not be collected but documentation of study design and methods will be stored as part of each study. Each design document is created before the study and stored for future reference. The video metadata is used for reference when writing papers which involve recording or use of video data but it is not an essential aspect. 

D. Video metadata will be collected from the camera using Wondershare Filmora or similar video software. Only necessary aspects are recording framerate and date/time of recording. Other metadata such as study design are stored in microsoft word or google drive documents. 

# Sharing and Preservation
1. There are factors which limit availability of my data. The primary data collected is video data on a vulnerable population so it is important to understand how this data can be shared. Based on our informed consent signed by the participant's parent or guardian, data may or may not be publically available. We are not intending to make the full video data publically available initially to ensure the safety and anonymity of our participants but we may use clips and images in presentations that could be made publically available. The restricted data is stored on an OSU secure server and may only be accessed by members of the team who have completed the necessary IRB training for working with human participants. This access is controlled by the research team, including myself and the PI. We may make some of the video data publically available as a dataset which can be used by others in the future but only for participants whose parent or guardian signed off on the informed consent.

Accelerometer data may be made publically available as it can be easily anonymized. It will still be dependent on the informed consent signed by the participant's parent or guardian. This data may be used for machine learning purposes by a research team and making it publically available for benchmarking is important to the research community.

Subjective data such as interview and survey data will not be made public and is only accessible by members of the research team who have completed the necessary IRB training for working with human participants. We will likely publish quotes from interview data in research publications but they will always be anonymized. 

2. Video data may be made public at a later point as part of a dataset which can be used by other researchers but there is no current timeline or plans for doing so. This data may be public in a repository which focuses specifically on datasets for working with children but only participants who have had their informed consent signed by parents or guardians will have that data potentially be made available. For now, this data can only be accessed by members of the research team who have been certified in the necessary IRB trainings. This data could be made publically available in a video format as defined by the respository. The licensing of data usage will be dependent on the repository and the data but only data which has been approved through informed consent would be considered. This makes it difficult for our research to be fully reproducible but we work with vulnerable populations so making the full data accessible requires a lot of consideration and understanding of informed consent from parents and guardians. The data of these populations must be protected and in some cases, the video data may need to be anonymized to ensure security of the participant. 

 Accelerometer data is much easier to anonymize and so may be made publically available in a repository such as Github. As this kind of data is commonly used in machine learning, making it publically available is important for the research community. We will continue to follow the same informed consent and only publish anonymized data which was originally approved by a parent or guardian. This data would be made available as excel spreadsheets as this is the most common method for storage and use of this data. The data may be converted into a format which is used by common machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and will be labeled as such for easy use.

 Subjective data such as interview and survey data will not be made publically available as a whole, even if anonymized. The questions which were asked in an interview or surveys used are likely to be made available so that the data can be reproducible but the responses will only be used in the context of a research publication. Any direct references to quotes from an interview or survey will be anonymized and made available through the research publication. Aggregate subjective data will again be made available in the context of a research publication. 

3. Video and accelerometer data will be collected and archived in a secure OSU Box server for up to 5 years post-collection. It will additionally be stored on a local secure password-protected hard drive which is maintained by my collaborators in Kinesiology. This ensures the data can be accessed in two secure locations for future data analysis and referred back to if needed. The video data is stored as MP4 files and the accelerometer data is stored as spreadsheets. The formats are the same in both locations. Accelerometer data may be converted to a common machine learning library format such as TensorFlow but will be stored in the same locations. 

Survey and interview data is stored locally on a paper copy which is located behind two locked doors in the research lab. Only specific members of the research team have the ability to get into the rooms during off-hours and if the room is open, there is always a member of the research team there. This data will be transcribed into the same secure OSU Box server as spreadsheet and text data and archived for the same amount of time. 

Access to the archived data is maintained by the PI and research team leads as identified by the PI. Only research team members who have completed the necessary IRB trainings may access the data and are unable to add new members. As research team leads graduate and move on, it is up to the PI to allocate new management of access to the data.
