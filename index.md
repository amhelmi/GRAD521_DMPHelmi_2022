# Data Description

 My research in robotics centers on child-robot interaction and how robots can help children with motor impairments receive the benefits that come with motor exploration and play. For children with motor impairments, they tend to be delayed in motor milestones such as crawling, walking, and running but an assistive robot may be a fun and more ideal way for children to practice motor skills. Studies have shown that treadmill training or similar types of interventions can promote early motor skills for children with motor impairments, but they can be boring and quite intense. Our assistive robot is combined with a body-weight support harness which allows supported but free motion for a child in a play space. The two combined means the assistive robot is a motivational tool that the child can chase around and play with while practicing crawling and walking skills. Our main research question is how well can an assistive robot encourage motor exploration and development in children with or without disabilities?

  For my studies, we will be collecting several forms of human-subjects data that I will describe and list out:
1.	Video data recording on children interacting with the robot during studies. This will usually be in the form of overhead video on a GoPro of a play space where a child and robot will be interacting. The video files will be collected and stored for post-hoc analysis. 
2.	Accelerometer data on devices worn by children during the studies. This data is stored in the device during the study and then uploaded later to the software and saved as spreadsheet files. We will analyze the data after each study. 
3.	Qualitative data. We will be collecting survey and interview data during studies. We will collect survey data in the form of printed forms that will be filled out during each play session by a parent or guardian. Interviews will be conducted in a semi-structured fashion and captured either with audio or video recordings which will be stored and analyzed later. 
  In addition to human-subjects data, we also will be collecting data on the robot while it is moving which will be used to further develop the algorithms which control the robot. This data will be in the form of logs of each action the robot performs and when so that it can be matched up to video data. Additionally, we have simulated data of child-robot interaction which generate text files of each action performed and how successful it was at encouraging motion in the simulated child.

* For the video data, we anticipate collecting 10-50 GBs.
* For the accelerometer data, we anticipate collecting up to 1-5 GBs worth of data.
* For the survey data, we expect to collect in the 1-10 GBs range of data due mainly to the interview recordings. The rest will be low impact.
* For data collected by the robot and simulated data, we anticipate about 100 MB worth of data.

# Roles and Responsibilities

The PI is responsible for generation and implementation of the DMP as they were the grant writer and had to include that as part of the grant proposal. They would have had assistance from co-PI’s to help ensure the plan made sense, protected data appropriately as we are working with human subjects, and was carried out effectively. The rest of the roles fall mainly to the graduate students and their undergraduates that they mentor. The graduate students, including myself and 2 others, are responsible for data collection/generation, data organization, archiving and preservation, protection of sensitive and protected data, data analysis, software creation and maintenance and instrumentation maintenance. If one of the graduate students or researchers involved with the project should leave, the responsibility falls to the PI to ensure the data is still maintained properly and that the project continues to move forward.

The data that I will collect will be sensitive and need to be protected as it involves child subjects. Our plan is to ensure that any data collected is secured and can only be accessed by members of the research team who have gone through the required IRB trainings to ensure they can be responsible with the data. On our consent forms, it indicates that some screenshots and gifs may be used from the studies in research papers and presentations but will not show identifying features such as faces. This allows parents to decide if they are comfortable with images or gifs being made from the videos and lets them know that only non-face identifying images will be used. Because we are using overhead video as our primary method of data evaluation, it is much easier to ensure that no identifying features are readily available. 

Data will be stored in a protected Google Drive which can only be accessed by members of the research team who have gone through the appropriate trainings and received the IRB certifications that allow access to sensitive data. Only Oregon State students and faculty that are approved can access the data and after someone leaves the university, they will be unable to access the data. Some data may be stored temporarily on local computers while being transferred over, but laptops will be secured via password and not shared with others outside of the research team. There will also be password protected hard drives which will also contain copies of the video data as backups.

There will be 2 copies of the data. One will be stored in google drive as the primary while the backups will live on password protected hard drives. This process is manual and the management of the Google Drive is also manual. We will be using no programs specifically to backup the data, only manual file transferring. We will be using a cloud system but the primary manager is the PI. The PI will ensure that data is transferred over through a graduate or undergraduate student when one leaves. This ensures that the data isn’t lost to an account that is deleted by the OSU system.
