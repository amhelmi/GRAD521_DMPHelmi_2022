# Data Description

	My research in robotics centers on child-robot interaction and how robots can help children with motor impairments receive the benefits that come with motor exploration and play. For children with motor impairments, they tend to be delayed in motor milestones such as crawling, walking, and running but an assistive robot may be a fun and more ideal way for children to practice motor skills. Studies have shown that treadmill training or similar types of interventions can promote early motor skills for children with motor impairments, but they can be boring and quite intense. Our assistive robot is combined with a body-weight support harness which allows supported but free motion for a child in a play space. The two combined means the assistive robot is a motivational tool that the child can chase around and play with while practicing crawling and walking skills. Our main research question is how well can an assistive robot encourage motor exploration and development in children with or without disabilities?

  For my studies, we will be collecting several forms of human-subjects data that I will describe and list out:
1.	Video data recording on children interacting with the robot during studies. This will usually be in the form of overhead video on a GoPro of a play space where a child and robot will be interacting. The video files will be collected and stored for post-hoc analysis. 
2.	Accelerometer data on devices worn by children during the studies. This data is stored in the device during the study and then uploaded later to the software and saved as spreadsheet files. We will analyze the data after each study. 
3.	Qualitative data. We will be collecting survey and interview data during studies. We will collect survey data in the form of printed forms that will be filled out during each play session by a parent or guardian. Interviews will be conducted in a semi-structured fashion and captured either with audio or video recordings which will be stored and analyzed later. 
  In addition to human-subjects data, we also will be collecting data on the robot while it is moving which will be used to further develop the algorithms which control the robot. This data will be in the form of logs of each action the robot performs and when so that it can be matched up to video data. Additionally, we have simulated data of child-robot interaction which generate text files of each action performed and how successful it was at encouraging motion in the simulated child.

For the video data, we anticipate collecting 10-50 GBs.
For the accelerometer data, we anticipate collecting up to 1-5 GBs worth of data.
For the survey data, we expect to collect in the 1-10 GBs range of data due mainly to the interview recordings. The rest will be low impact.
For data collected by the robot and simulated data, we anticipate about 100 MB worth of data.
